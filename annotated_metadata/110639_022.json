    "Text": " The picture shows an interior space with a focus on the bottom of a light fixture that appears to be a pendant light hanging from a ceiling. There is a beam of light emanating from it, suggesting it is turned on. The background is blurred but gives the impression of an indoor room with a vertical surface and what looks like a whiteboard or screen against a dark wall. "
